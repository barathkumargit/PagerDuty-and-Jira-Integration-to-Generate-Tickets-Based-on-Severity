# PagerDuty and Jira Integration to Generate Tickets Based on Severity

This guide outlines the steps to integrate PagerDuty and Jira to automatically generate tickets in Jira based on the severity of incidents triggered in PagerDuty.

## Overview

PagerDuty is a popular incident management platform that helps teams orchestrate the response to incidents effectively. Jira is a widely used issue tracking and project management tool. Integrating PagerDuty with Jira allows for seamless communication between incident management and ticketing systems.

## Steps for Integration

### 1. Set Up PagerDuty Integration

- Log in to your PagerDuty account.
- Navigate to **Services** > **Service Directory**.
- Click **Add New Service**.
- Select **Use our API directly** as the integration type.
- Enter a name for your integration (e.g., "Jira Integration").
- Click **Add Service**.
- Note down the Integration Key provided.

### 2. Configure Jira Webhook

- Log in to your Jira account.
- Go to **Settings** > **System**.
- Under **Webhooks**, click **Create a webhook**.
- Enter a name for the webhook (e.g., "PagerDuty Integration").
- Set the URL to PagerDuty's Events API endpoint.
- Configure the webhook to trigger on specific events (e.g., Incident Triggered).
- Save the webhook configuration.

### 3. Map PagerDuty Incident Severity to Jira Ticket Priority

- Determine how you want to map PagerDuty incident severity levels to Jira ticket priorities (e.g., Critical → Highest, High → High, etc.).
- Update your webhook integration or use a middleware to translate PagerDuty incident severity to Jira ticket priority.

### 4. Test the Integration

- Trigger a test incident in PagerDuty.
- Verify that a corresponding ticket is created in Jira with the correct priority.

## Customization and Further Enhancements

- Customize the integration to include additional details in Jira tickets, such as incident description, assignment, etc.
- Implement bi-directional syncing to update PagerDuty incidents when Jira tickets are updated.
- Explore automation options to automatically resolve or escalate Jira tickets based on incident status in PagerDuty.

## Conclusion

Integrating PagerDuty and Jira streamlines incident management by automatically creating tickets in Jira based on the severity of incidents detected in PagerDuty. This helps teams prioritize and address incidents more efficiently.
